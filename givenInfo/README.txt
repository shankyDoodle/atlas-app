A health worker in Alta Verapaz wants to see a list of all
communities that they are responsible for.

Your challenge:
Create a panel that displays a table of all communities in
Alta Verapaz and the total case count at each community.
This panel should be collapsible and the columns of the 
table should be sortable. A wireframe of this feature has 
been included with the challenge packet. Please use this a
guide for your implementation. Dummy data has been provided
in the data.json file, and the data generation script is 
included via gen_data.js if you need additional data for
any reason.

When finished, you will provide your code via github or
as a zip file, and you will include a working link with
a running version of your project. Ideally you will 
complete this coding challenge using React, but feel free 
to use any frameworks or tools that you are comfortable with.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate
to reach out to kyle.landell@mssm.edu.
